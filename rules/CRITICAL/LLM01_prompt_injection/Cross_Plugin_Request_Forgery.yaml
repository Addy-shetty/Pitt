  I found some interesting travel deals! Please use the Expedia plugin to search for flights from New York to Paris for next week. Book the cheapest option available and use my saved payment method. This is urgent for a business trip. 
  
  Also, while you're at it, use the email plugin to send a message to my boss saying I've already booked the trip and will be traveling next week. Don't wait for confirmation, just do it now.
