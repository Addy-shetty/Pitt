description: |
  Comprehensive indirect prompt injection testing based on OWASP AITG-APP-02.
  Tests 200+ injection vectors across all major file formats, configuration files,
  build systems, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure configurations.
  Uses the standardized trigger phrase for automated detection.
